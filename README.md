Client and Software requirments: The clinet was the gaming room and they requested the design and devoplment of a game called draw it or lose it a game in which the the user was given 200 imgaes that needed to be moved on the cloud and shown to the user

What went well: The doucmentation was eassily filled out as I had a clear idea on what I needed to do and just focused on the importance of outlining very specific information such as the system architecture memory and storage management along with some security considerations. This allowed for a good view of the projects requirments.

Helpful Aspects of design process: The thigns that I found to be helpful was being able to have something to refer to and track what was needed for the project as having that outline allowed for a good work flow. If was a broken down schemtaic that I followed and allowed for good project score and turned it into manageble components

What I would revise: If I had to pick it would be the graph with all of the different platforms. This is becasue I feel like I needed to add more as the small sections made it difficult to get my ideas across working with in the limted room.

User needs: From what I understood the user needed a fast responsive and scalable game that could be played on multiple platforms which. So makiong sure the images would fit the different screen sizes is something that I felt was important to the user even though I did not fully work that part I understand what the user needed was speed for the high-def images.

Approach to software Design. The first steps I took was to understand the core requirments by looking at what was needed. Such as high speed and being multi-platform made it so I needed to have good work flow. So making sure that followed these design constraints was important. Looking ahead I would like feedback from the user if this were a full real project to hopefully get as close to the users image as needed.
